# About ME
I have always walked to my own beat. My name is Kyle Mooney, I have been in the creative field for 18yrs.  I have worked with a plethora of clients across various industries including: 
RideNow Powersports, Honda, Kawasaki, Harley-Davidson, Insight Enterprises, Zia Records, PetSmart, and Discount Tire. 

I have been in charge of creative and development teams. I excel as a problem solver finding creative and practical solutions for team members and clients. I am motivated by working on projects, designs I am passionate about. Working with me you will find I have a positive attitude and willingness to learn, which has helped mold me into a reliable and innovative team player.

My inspiration comes from a constant pursuit of learning. I don’t believe in a work life balance, there is simply life balance. My attitude and willingness to learn has helped me stay on top of the latest in design and development trends. 

Part of a life balance includes enjoying what you do, and making the most of your time away from work.
